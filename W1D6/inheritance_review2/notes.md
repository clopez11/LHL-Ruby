Class == type or category

<!-- Inheritance -->
- Objects receives messages
No matter how complicated the code, the receiving object handles the message 2 differen ways.
1. Respond directly to it
2. Passes the the message to other objects for a response.

- Object have a relationship with one another. 
If the object receives a message it doesn't understand then it forwards or delegates the message to other.

- Subclass is allowed only one parent superclass (single inheritance)
subclasses are specializations of their superclass
a subclass should be everything a superclass is and more

- Duck types share code via modules.

- Sending super in any method passes that message up the superclass chain.

- For inheritance to work, two things must always be true.
1. objects you are modelling must have a generalization-specialization
2. correct coding techniques must be used

- separate the concrete from the abstract
